# Getting Started with this course

We are very excited for you to start this course and see what you get inspired to build with Generative AI!

To ensure your success, this page outlines setup steps, technical requirements, and where to get help if needed.

## Setup Steps

To start taking this course, you will need to complete the following steps.

### 1. Fork this Repo

[Fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to find it and related repos easier.

### 2. Create a codespace

To avoid any dependency issues when running the code, we recommend running this course in a [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

In your fork: **Code -> Codespaces -> New on main**

## Lessons and Technical Requirements

The course has 6 concept lessons and 6 coding lessons.

For the coding lessons, we are using the Azure OpenAI Service. You will need access to the Azure OpenAI service and an API key to run this code. You can apply to get access by [completing this application](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

While you wait for your application to be processed, each coding lesson also includes a `README.md` file where you can view the code and outputs.

## Using the Azure OpenAI Service for the first time

If this is your first time working with the Azure OpenAI service, please follow this guide on how to [create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

## Using the OpenAI API for the first time

If this is your first time working with the OpenAI API, please follow the guide on how to [create and use the Interface.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=pythont&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

## Meet Other Learners

We have created channels in our official [AI Community Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) for meeting other learners. This is a great way to network with other like-minded entrepreneurs, builders, students, and anyone looking to level up in Generative AI.

[![Join discord channel](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://aka.ms/genai-discord?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

The project team will also be on this Discord server to help any learners.
